About: I am Chithra R, a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in web development and open-source collaboration. I enjoy learning by building real-world projects and understanding how collaborative software is developed and maintained. Through open-source, I aim to improve my technical skills, learn best practices, and contribute meaningfully to developer communities while growing as a responsible engineer.
